# Speech To Text (STT)

This chapter describes how STT engine works.

The STT is a programs or API that converts the speech into text.
Each STT has a specific configuration and supports multiple languages.

The configuration of each STT you use must appear in the [settings.yml](settings.md) file.

## Settings

The setting.yml defines the STT you want to use by default
```yml
default_speech_to_text: "type default STT here"
```

Then, still in the settings.yml file, each STT must set up its configuration following the 'speech_to_text' tag :
```yml
speech_to_text:
   - STT1:
      STT1parameter1: "value option1"
      STT1parameter2: "value option2"
   - STT2:
      STT2parameter1: "value option1"
```
Sometime, an API key will be necessary to use an engine. Click on a TTS engine link in the `Current CORE Available STT` section to know which parameter are required.

## Current CORE Available STT

Core STTs are already packaged with the installation of Kalliope an can be used out of the box. See the [complete list here](stt_list.md).

## STT Community Installation

Community STTs need to be installed manually.

Use the CLI
```bash
kalliope install --git-url <git_url>
```

You may be prompted to type your `sudo` password during the process. You can see the list of [available STT here](stt_list.md)
